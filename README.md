# EcoFOCI_eofs

Tested on python 3.6

# Based on python EOF analysis package:
http://ajdawson.github.io/eofs/index.html
https://github.com/ajdawson/eofs

Many results are not relevant here for these purposes from this package and are available as analysis extensions.

### Science Notes

We expect to have the same number of EOF's / PCS's as we have timeseries


### Roadmap

1) ~~Specify list of files to read from (*.point)~~
1) ~~Read in EPIC flavored NetCDF (custom netCDF4 libs or xarray with no cf compliance)~~
1) Ouptut Results file, EPIC NetCDF EOFS, plots
